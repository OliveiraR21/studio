# Br Supply Academy Stream

This is a Next.js application for the Br Supply Academy Stream platform.

## Getting Started

This project is configured to run with local mock data, so no external services like Firebase are required for it to work.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result. The application will load with pre-configured test users and courses, simulating an "Admin" login.
